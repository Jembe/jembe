Jembe Web Framework
===================

Python Web Framework for developing modern web applications, build on top of Flask and designed with following goals in mind:

- Whole web app is build using custom, reusable, reactive, responsive Web UI components;
- Allowing developers to stay focused on implementing "business" logic and writing UI logic only for very specific app use cases;
- New UI Component is created by extending Python class with simple API and writing associated Jinja2 HTML templates; 
- Complex UI interactions can be created without or with minimal use of javascript code (one liners embeded directly in HTML template);
- There should be no reason to think off, consider or implement logic for:
        - Handling http request-response cycle
        - Handling routing
        - Handling any "low level" web/http api
